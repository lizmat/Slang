NAME
====

Slangify - Provide an easy interface to activating slangs

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
# Code of a slang module with only a grammar change
role Grammar { ... }
use Slangify Grammar, Mu;

# Code of a slang module with both grammar and actions
role Grammar { ... }
role Actions { ... }
use Slangify Grammar, Actions;

# Code of a slang module with only an actions change
role Actions { ... }
use Slangify Mu, Actions;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `Slangify` module is a module intended for slang developers.

It abstracts the internals of slang creation and activation so that module developers of slangs have a consistent interface they can work with across current and future versions of the Raku Programming Language.

This module is **only** needed to install a module that provides a slang. And as such, would only need to be specified in the `build-depends` section of the META information.

Note that the absence of a grammar role or an actions role, can be indicated by specifying `Mu`. Sadly, some core ideosyncracies make it currently impossible to indicate no change otherwise.
