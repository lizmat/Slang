NAME
====

Slangify - Provide an easy interface to activating slangs

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
# Code of a slang module with only a grammar change
role Foo::Grammar { ... }
use Slangify Foo::Grammar, Mu;

# Code of a slang module with both grammar and actions
role Foo::Grammar { ... }
role Foo::Actions { ... }
use Slangify Foo::Grammar, Foo::Actions;

# Code of a slang module with only an actions change
role Foo::Actions { ... }
use Slangify Mu, Foo::Actions;

# code of a slang module with legacy grammar
role Foo::Grammar { ... }
role Foo::Actions { ... }
role Foo::Grammar::Legacy { ... }
role Foo::Actions::Legacy { ... }
use Slangify Foo::Grammar, Foo::Actions,
  Foo::Grammar::Legacy, Foo::Actions::Legacy;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `Slangify` module is a module intended for slang developers.

It abstracts the internals of slang creation and activation so that module developers of slangs have a consistent interface they can work with across current and future versions of the Raku Programming Language.

This module is **only** needed to install a module that provides a slang. And as such, would only need to be specified in the `build-depends` section of the META information.

Note that the absence of a grammar role or an actions role, can be indicated by specifying `Mu`. Sadly, some core ideosyncracies make it currently impossible to indicate no change otherwise.

If the given grammar / actions can work with both the legacy grammar, as well as with the new RakuAST based grammar, then no changes are needed. If there **is** a different grammar for the legacy grammar and/or actions for the legacy grammar, then you can specify these as the 3rd and 4th argument in the `use Slangify` statement.

ADDITIONAL EXPORTS
==================

The `Slangify` module also exports special candidates for postcircumfix `{ }` and for prefix `~`. This allows slang developers to remain closer to original grammar code which is often living in NQP land, e.g.: `~$<identifier> eq 'foo'`. Without these special candidates, slang developers would need to resort to using NQP ops.
